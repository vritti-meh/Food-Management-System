## Domain Name: Food Management
## Project Title: Food Order Management 
## System Project Description: 
The concept of food delivery isn’t new. From ordering telephonically to using dedicated online platforms linked to a particular restaurant, the process of ordering food has become quite easy. Over the past 5-7 years the food industry has gone through a significant revolution. Customers can now easily order food online and have it delivered to their homes within the shortest time possible. In fact, the growth rate for online food ordering and restaurant delivery has been over 20% over the last five years.
The rise of digital technology has transformed the food delivery process and reshaped the market.Instead of going to the restaurant, customers are now placing their orders via restaurant apps and websites. For their part, restaurants assure transparency and convenience in their services. Once the order had been placed online, the restaurant fulfills it by ensuring the food is delivered to the customer’s home.
Thus, digital food delivery management is on the cusp of a major expansion in emerging markets.
